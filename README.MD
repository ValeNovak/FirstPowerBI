# OVERVIEW

This Power BI report is one of the first dashboards I created while learning the tool, and it was specifically developed as part of a task I received during a job application process. The company provided a fictional Excel dataset consisting of four tables.

The task itself was described in a single sentence: using one of the OLAP-style tables, I was asked to visualize the KOL_SJ column by objects and months. Additionally, the report needed to include filter slicers for marketing segments and countries.

This project allowed me to get hands-on experience with data modeling, using slicers to enable interactivity, and designing a clean and functional layout suitable for business reporting. Although based on fictional data, it was a great introduction to translating business requirements into a visual story using Power BI.
